# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2016 - Refactoring Old JS

I had some time on the train back to DC from New York, so I cracked open my laptop and got to coding. The internet on the train leaves a bit to be desired, so I figured that the best way for me to spend some time was to refactor some old JavaScript from my color guessing game.&nbsp;

The code is a complete mess - variables everywhere, no comments, etc. It's basically unreadable, and if anyone even tried to look at it on my GitHub, I'm pretty sure they would explode. I'm porting over the code to a much more manageable MVC organizational framework, which will make things much prettier to read. Not to mention easier to update and add features to in the future.&nbsp;
