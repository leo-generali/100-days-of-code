# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2016 - Refactoring Old JS

I had some time on the train back to DC from New York, so I cracked open my laptop and got to coding. The internet on the train leaves a bit to be desired, so I figured that the best way for me to spend some time was to refactor some old JavaScript from my color guessing game.

The code is a complete mess - variables everywhere, no comments, etc. It's basically unreadable, and if anyone even tried to look at it on my GitHub, I'm pretty sure they would explode. I'm porting over the code to a much more manageable MVC organizational framework, which will make things much prettier to read. Not to mention easier to update and add features to in the future.

### Day 1: January 3, 2016 - Udacity Final Project, Hugo

Kicked off the 100 Days of Code by working on the Udacity Final Project - the neighborhood map. I'm excited to see this through to completion, because it'll be a really expansive app that will look great on my portfolio! Plus, working with knockout.js and the Google maps API is a great learning experience.

I also took a little time to myself and fiddled around with Hugo. I thought it was going to be complicated, but it doesn't look like it's too hard to set up.

**Link to Work:** None - I didn't upload anything to GitHub.

### Day 2: January 4, 2016 - Udacity Final Project

I was running into a lot of closure and scope related issues, but poking around in the Udacity forums and checking out the old lessons led me to the right fix.

As of right now, my map displays every metro station in the DMV area. When the map marker is clicked, that station's name is displayed. There's still a lot of work to be done, but it's all shaping up nicely!

*Side note*: I'm really enjoying this 100 Days of Code challenge. I didn't think I'd like it this much, but interacting with the community in the small ways I have so far has been so great.

### Day 3: January 5, 2016 - Udacity Final Project

Slower day today... I kept on running into some pretty serious dead ends. 

Having a really hard time figuring out how I'm supposed to incorporate knockout.js into this project. I have a suspicion that I'll be reading up on a fair share of tutorials online.

### Day 4: January 6, 2016 - Udacity Final Project

Calling it a day early. Still having some trouble with knockout.js so I decided to make the app look nicer. Will try and get in some more coding if I can make within the day.
